Leveraging Machine Learning and AI to Enable the Automation of Mobile Electric Vehicle Chargers at Autev.

Goal:
- Shift 2D detection to 3D spatial detection for more accurate guidance to the robot arm.
  - We need to collect data sources like depth-sensing cameras, LiDAR sensors, or even multiple 2D cameras to construct 3D models.
  - An alternative is to adjust the camera angle to get a perfect circle from a distance before moving closer.
